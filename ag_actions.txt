To create an Amazon AWS Bedrock agent for handling eligibility and benefits verification phone calls between therapists and payers, we'd want to design action groups and actions that cover the key aspects of this process. Here's a breakdown of potential action groups and actions:

Patient Identification

VerifyPatientInfo: Confirm patient's name, date of birth, and insurance ID
CheckPatientEligibility: Determine if the patient is currently eligible for benefits


Insurance Verification

VerifyInsuranceCoverage: Check if the patient's insurance is active and covers mental health services
GetCoverageDetails: Retrieve specific coverage information for mental health services


Benefits Information

CheckCopayAmount: Determine the patient's copay for therapy sessions
VerifyDeductible: Check the patient's current deductible status and remaining amount
GetOutOfPocketMax: Retrieve the patient's out-of-pocket maximum and current status


Service Authorization

CheckAuthorizationRequirement: Determine if pre-authorization is required for services
InitiateAuthorizationRequest: Start the process for obtaining authorization if needed
CheckAuthorizationStatus: Verify the status of an existing authorization


Provider Network Status

VerifyNetworkStatus: Check if the therapist is in-network with the insurance plan
GetOutOfNetworkBenefits: Retrieve out-of-network coverage details if applicable


Session Limits

CheckSessionLimits: Verify the number of covered therapy sessions per year or treatment plan
GetRemainingSessionsCount: Determine how many covered sessions the patient has left


Claim Submission

VerifyClaimSubmissionProcess: Confirm the correct procedure for submitting claims
CheckClaimStatus: Investigate the status of a previously submitted claim
